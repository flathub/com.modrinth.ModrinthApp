        <p>Bugfixes 🐛</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No longer enables LWJGL debugging mode by default, potentially improving game performance.</li>
          <li>Changing app directory to a different drive now properly moves all your files.</li>
          <li>Live log will no longer glitch out and will not use as much memory.</li>
          <li>Removed java_options flag that caused random fatal Java errors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What's next for Modrinth App? 👀</p>
        <p>We're working on these, but they didn't quite make it into this release just yet! Keep an eye out for v0.8 in the coming weeks!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add support for recent versions of Minecraft Forge 🔨: Recent versions of the Forge installer have broken how we install Forge. We're working on implementing ForgeWrapper to more easily support Forge like other launchers do.</li>
          <li>Improve logging for debug purposes 📜: Other launchers append extra data or create extra log files to provide more debugging information, and many users have provided feedback that Modrinth App not providing these makes it harder to provide support for Modrinth App users. We're working to improve our logging to be just as easy as other launchers.</li>
        </ul>
